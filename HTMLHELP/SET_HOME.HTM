    Choose Set Home/Reference button from the toolbar or 
    type H to change the label/name for your
    'home'. Once chosen you will be prompted 
    to type in  your current location in the world. This either be a your town, city, state, name,
    company or whatever you like. Once you have done this hit the enter key. This will take you back 
    to the main user screen. Your  home location will appear at the top in yellow text, surrounded by a yellow border.
    WorldTime2000 uses the Time Zone settings from you computer ( see control  panel )&nbsp;to determine your
    current time, date and daylight savings for your location. No matter what city, state, or country you  type in, 
    WorldTime2000 will always use the information from the computer's internal clock and date set.
