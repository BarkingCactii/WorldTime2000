<H4>Add to Locations List</H4>

<P class=hotkey>Hot key A</P>

<p>
    This function allows you 
    to add a location to the already large list of world cities 
    availably in WorldTime2000. If you have a location you wish to add choose the 'Add to 
    locations list' button in the toolbar or use the hot key A. You will be prompted 
    to enter the Name/Town. EXAMPLE: Sydney or even Bob's place. Enter the country ( this is optional ).
	Then you will asked the Offset in hours from GMT. This is amount of time plus (+) or minus 
    (-) of GMT. You will need to know if the city, town, etc, is currently 
    on Daylight Savings and the start and ending dates. This can also be entered here. 
        If you do not know if the location you wish to add is a user of daylight 
    savings of not, you may not get a correct time reading to another location in 
    WorldTime2000. Once you have entered your new location to add to WorldTime2000 press the ok 
    button. You will the find you new location added to&nbsp;the list of locations found in the 
    Add locations to display list. More often then not you new location will be 
    added to the bottom of the list and not necessarily in alphabetical order. 
</p>

<P class=hotkey>
Hot key M

<p>
    This is the same screen that was to 
    be found under add to display by pressing the "Show Details" button. You are 
    able to select a location in the list of locations that appear on the screen. 
    You are able to change the offset in hours from GMT, and adjust the daylight 
    savings details. As before you are able to modify a location by pressing the 
    modify button. A location can be re-modified by re-selecting that location. You 
    can access the feature by using the hot key M.

<P class=hotkey>
    Hot key Ctrl-D
</P>

<P> 
    This function allows you to delete a location from the list of cities. This 
    program will ask you to confirm that you wish to delete this location. Once 
    a location has been deleted, the only way to re-establish that location back 
    into the list is to use the Add location feature of the WorldTime2000 program. 
</P>

<H4>Add Location to Display</H4>
<P class=hotkey>
Hot key D
</P>

<P>          
    This function allows you to choose one of the many cities already programed into WorldTime 2000. Once the button 
    has been selected a box with a list will appear. The cites are initially shown 
    in alphabetical order by the first letter of the city. 
	To sort the list by ascending/descending by city, country or time, click on the 
	column headers "Location", "Country" or "GMT". These sorting preferences will be saved for all
	location lists, such as those in Modify Location & Delete Location, as well as Add Location
	to Display. Once you have highlighted a city you have the option of seeing more details about 
    that city, by selecting the "show details" button. If this button is selected you 
    will see a more detailed outline of the city. This will show the offset in 
    hours from GMT and weather or not the location is subject to daylight 
    savings. You will notice that this box is the same as the "add location" 
    except for one minor difference. You have the option to modify this location 
    at this point. As before you will be able to see the starting and 
    ending dates for the daylight savings. If a location is modified you are able 
    to return to that location and change the setting back to the original setting or choose a new setting. Once 
    you have selected a location to add to the display and press the button 
    marked "OK", this location will be added to the WorldTime 2000 display screen.&nbsp;The 
    add location to display may also be accessed by using the hot key D.
