<H4>Set/Clear Alarm</H4>

<P class=hotkey>
    Right click on location and choose Set/Clear Alarm
</P>

<p>
    This function allows you set an alarm for the selected 
	location.To turn an alarm on, make sure
    the check box is checked. To 
    turn it off, be sure the check box is clear. The time is in 
    the time of the selected location, not your home time, unless the location you selected 
    is home. For example, suppose you had to call a friend in Rome, 
    Italy at 10am. Choose Set/Clear alarm for Rome, Italy and enable the check box, 
    and set the hour to 10:00. Type in an optional message if you 
    prefer. If you optionally want an application to be run, press Pick Application, and choose
	the application to run, and make sure enable is checked. At 10:00am Rome time, the alarm will sound, and the alarm message will 
    flash on screen. The alarm will continue to sound until you turn the alarm 
    off. This is done by choosing Reset Alarm from the menu or using hot key space bar. Please note that the&nbsp;alarm 
    re-arms itself after approximately 1 minute. In other words, if you have an alarm 
    set to go off 1 minute after the other, the second one may 
    not go off, depending on how quickly you choose to reset the first alarm.

    not miss an alarm if you are near your computer!
