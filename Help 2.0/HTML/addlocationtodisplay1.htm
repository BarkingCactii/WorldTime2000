<H3 id=_D2HTopic_169>Add Location to Display</H3>
<P class=MsoBodyText>This function allows you to choose one of the many cities 
already programed into WorldTime 2000. Once the button has been selected a box 
with a list will appear. The cites are initially shown in alphabetical order by 
the first letter of the city. To sort the list by ascending/descending by city, 
country or time, click on the column headers "Location", "Country" or "GMT". 
These sorting preferences will be saved for all location lists, such as those in 
Modify Location &amp; Delete Location, as well as Add Location to Display. Once 
you have highlighted a city you have the option of seeing more details about 
that city, by selecting the "show details" button. If this button is selected 
you will see a more detailed outline of the city. This will show the offset in 
hours from GMT and weather or not the location is subject to daylight savings. 
You will notice that this box is the same as the "add location" except for one 
minor difference. You have the option to modify this location at this point. As 
before you will be able to see the starting and ending dates for the daylight 
savings. If a location is modified you are able to return to that location and 
change the setting back to the original setting or choose a new setting. Once 
you have selected a location to add to the display and press the button marked 
"OK", this location will be added to the WorldTime 2000 display screen.&nbsp;The 
add location to display may also be accessed by using the hot key D. </P>
