<P>This feature allows you to play What if ? with a time of your choice. For 
example, suppose you had to call a friend who lived in Paris at 6pm their time. 
To do this, you would need to know what time to call him in your local time. 
Firstly, you would add Paris to your display, then right click on Paris, or 
Choose What if... from the actions menu. Enter the time 6pm and click Ok. All 
the locations in the display will now reflect their local time when it is 6pm 
Paris time. To let you know you are in What If ? mode, and not the current mode, 
a series of question marks will flash on the screen.If you click on any other 
the other locations, What if ? will change your new selected location to 6pm, 
and show all the other locations local time. </P>
<P>To exit this mode, or to toggle it on and off, choose What if ? from the view 
menu.&nbsp; </P>
