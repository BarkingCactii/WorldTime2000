<P>This function allows you to choose one of the many cities already programed 
into WorldTime 2000. Once the button has been selected a box with a list will 
appear. The cites are initially shown in alphabetical order by the first letter 
of the city. To sort the list by ascending/descending by city, country or time, 
click on the column headers "Location", "Country" or "GMT". These sorting 
preferences will be saved for all location lists, such as those in Modify 
Location &amp; Delete Location, as well as Add Location to Display. Once you 
have highlighted a city you have the option of seeing more details about that 
city, by selecting the "show details" button. If this button is selected you 
will see a more detailed outline of the city. This will show the offset in hours 
from GMT and weather or not the location is subject to daylight savings. You 
will notice that this box is the same as the "add location" except for one minor 
difference. You have the option to modify this location at this point. As before 
you will be able to see the starting and ending dates for the daylight savings. 
If a location is modified you are able to return to that location and change the 
setting back to the original setting or choose a new setting. Once you have 
selected a location to add to the display and press the button marked "OK", this 
location will be added to the WorldTime 2000 display screen.&nbsp;The add 
location to display may also be accessed by using the hot key D. </P>
