<P class=hotkey>Right click on location and choose Set/Clear Alarm </P>
<P>This function allows you set an alarm for the selected location.To turn an 
alarm on, make sure the check box is checked. To turn it off, be sure the check 
box is clear. The time is in the time of the selected location, not your home 
time, unless the location you selected is home. For example, suppose you had to 
call a friend in Rome, Italy at 10am. Choose Set/Clear alarm for Rome, Italy and 
enable the check box, and set the hour to 10:00. Type in an optional message if 
you prefer. If you optionally want an application to be run, press Pick 
Application, and choose the application to run, and make sure enable is checked. 
At 10:00am Rome time, the alarm will sound, and the alarm message will flash on 
screen. The alarm will continue to sound until you turn the alarm off. This is 
done by choosing Reset Alarm from the menu or using hot key space bar. Please 
note that the&nbsp;alarm re-arms itself after approximately 1 minute. In other 
words, if you have an alarm set to go off 1 minute after the other, the second 
one may not go off, depending on how quickly you choose to reset the first 
alarm. </P>
