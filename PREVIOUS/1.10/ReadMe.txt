To Do:

Install/Uninstall program
Would it be possible to minimize it to the System Tray?
Would it be possible to change the colors (e.g. background, time
Change fonts/column widths
Add time zone information eg PST PDT etc
Another possible feature is an alarm or reminder dialogue that can be set by
the time in any time zone.
If you right click anywhere in the background, u r asked conformation 
of loaction deletion. Did u want that? 

Also, how about being able to move the different times by dragging 
them up and down your list? What about double-clicking a location to 
be able to modify it? The spinning globe would be nice if u could 
position it on what corner you wanted it. Where it is at the moment, 
it's hard to read the times infront of it.
 2/ Fonts can be resize with windows (long location names overlapped
the display time)
