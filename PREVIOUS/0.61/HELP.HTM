<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>
  WorldTime2000 is a small utility for simultaneously viewing many different time
 zones from around the world. Useful for anybody who has ever needed to know what the
  current time is in another part of the world. You can compare times from as many time zones
   as your display will allow. Great for those who travel or plan to travel, have
    business dealings on a national or international level, or have family who live
	
        long distances. WorldTime2000 will
        automatically detect your home, then by simply selecting locations in the 'Add Location 
		to Display' dialog, WorldTime2000 will display the current time for that location, 
		plus the date, the difference in hours from the home location,  
		and if that location is currently in daylight savings.

<H2>Using WorldTime2000</H2>
<P>
	WorldTime2000 works by having a pre-defined list of locations which contain all the necessary
	time information for all major regions around the world. Each location contains information 
	such as hours from GMT, and Daylight savings information. Information about locations can be 
	customized in any way; you can add locations to this list, modify, or delete them. 
	Locations can be cities, states, company branches, relatives/friends homes.

<H3>The Display</H3>
<P>This is what you see on the screen </P>         

<P>
 This displays a list of locations, line by line. 
Each location will be displayed, city and then country. The icon of the sun 
indicates if that location is currently on daylight savings. If no sun is present 
then that location is currently not on daylight savings at this time. The Time 
at that location will appear next. This is the current time at that location. 
The Date appears after the time. The last item to show on the same line of 
your newly added location, will be a number either, plus (+) of Minus (-). 
This number is to indicate the number of hours from your home location that you 
selected under Set Home/Reference. 
The display screen has all the information you need to 
have in order to find the difference in time from one place to another, and the 
number of hours difference from one location to another. All locations in green 
will show the number of hours difference from your home location on the far 
right side of the screen. This will either be a plus (+) or minus (-) number to 
your home location. If your wish to see the difference between two locations in 
green, you can <EM>
          
                
             
              
                 
              
   <STRONG>Left click</STRONG> </EM> on a <FONT color=#00ff00><STRONG>green 
location</STRONG></FONT>, this will highlight that <FONT 
color=#ff0000><STRONG>location in red</STRONG></FONT>.&nbsp; At that time all 
the numbers on the far right will either be plus (+) or minus (-) to that red 
highlighted location, including your home location. If you <STRONG><EM>right click 
</EM>  
</STRONG>on a location it will remove that location from the display but not from the locations  list. To 
re-select that city, press the 'Add location to display' button, and re-select that city.

        current time, date and daylight savings&nbsp;for your location. No matter what city, state, or country you  type in, 
        WorldTime2000 will always use the information from the computer's internal clock and date set.
