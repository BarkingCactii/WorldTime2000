WorldTime2000 2.00 Beta 1
(C)1999 PCM Computer Systems Pty Ltd

Installing WorldTime2000 - ( for those that received WorldTime2000 as a ZIP file )

WorldTime2000 uses a self extracting install program. Simply click on the file
wt2k-2b1.exe under Winzip or Explorer, and follow the instructions. Icons will
be created on your desktop, and start menu.

Requirments

WorldTime2000 will run under Win95/95/NT4/2000.
WorldTime2000 is a tidy application, files are not copied to the windows
directory, nor does it create temporary files.

This version uses HTML help. This feature requires MS Internet Explorer 4.01 
or later be installed on your computer. You may still use another browser 
for web surfing. The reason : MS Internet Explorer adds desktop enhancements
to Windows which allows for HTML help.

If you do not have MS Internet Explorer 4.01 installed, and do not wish
to do so, thats ok, you can still use the program, but you will not be able
to read the help, release notes, ordering or about screens.

Also please note that the sound support is only for wave files in standard
PCM format. This is the standard format, but I do not know how to convert
wave files in other formats to PCM format. Anyone ??
