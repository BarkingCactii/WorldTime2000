<H2>Using WorldTime2000</H2>

<P>
    WorldTime2000 works by having 
    a pre-defined list of locations which contain all the necessary time information for all
    major regions and time zones from around the world. Each location contains information 
    such as hours from GMT, and Daylight savings information. Information about locations can be 
    customized in any way; you can add locations to this list, modify, or delete them. 
    Locations can be cities, states, company branches, relatives/friends homes.<BR><BR>

    Using WorldTime2000  falls into 3 categories
</P>

    </strong>

<H3>The Display</H3>

<P>
    This is what you see on the screen<BR>

    <A href="images/worldtime.gif">
        <IMG alt="" border=0 height=230 src="help.gif" title="WorldTime2000 display screen" width=356 ></A>

    <BR>
    Quick view of WorldTime2000 display
    <ol>
        <li> Your home - Your home is automatically detected. You may choose to give it any name you prefer though
        <li> This location shows that an alarm has been set for it
        <li> This location is currently in DST ( Daylight savings )
        <li> This location does not have DST at all
        <li> This location does use DST, but it is not currently in DST
        <li> When you select a location, the location is underlined with the house icon
             This is your temporary 'home', and all hour differences are calculated as differences from this location
        <li> Time Zones as well as locations are supplied
        <li>Look what you get when you register! Your name goes 
  here</li>           
    </ol>
<P></P>

<P>
    This displays a list of locations, line by line. Each location will be 
    displayed, city and then country.&nbsp;Following that are a series of status icons. The time 
    at that location will appear next. This is the current time at that location. 
    The Date appears after the time. The last item to show on the same line of 
    your newly added location, will be a number either, plus (+) of Minus (-). 
    This number is to indicate the number of hours from your home location that you 
    selected under Set Home/Reference. 
    The display screen has all the information you need to 
    have in order to find the difference in time from one place to another, and the 
    number of hours difference from one location to another. All locations&nbsp;will show the 
    number of hours difference from your home location on the far right side of 
    the screen. This will either be a plus (+) or minus (-) number of hours to your 
    home location. If your wish to see the difference between two locations other than 
    home, you can <EM><STRONG>Left click</STRONG></EM> on a 
    location, this will <STRONG>underline</STRONG> that 
location, which is now your temporary 'home'. Alternatively, if your mouse sits 
on a location for more than 2 seconds, it will be automatically selected, with a tool tip showing brief information for 
    that location. Now all the numbers on the far right will either be plus (+) 
    or minus (-) number of hours from your temporary 'home', including your home location. 
    If you <STRONG><EM>right click </EM></STRONG>on a location you will have the option to 
    <EM>view, delete, move or Set/Clear Alarm </EM> for a location.
</P>

<P>
    <STRONG>Note</STRONG>: If you remove a location from the display, it does not remove that 
    location from the locations list, just the display. To remove a location from a list,
    choose 'Delete from Locations List' ( even though it is not recommended to do so ).
</P>

<H4>Set Home/Reference</H4>

<P class=hotkey>Hot key H</P>         

<P>
    Choose Set Home/Reference button from the toolbar or 
    type H to change the label/name for your
    'home'. Once chosen you will be prompted 
    to type in  your current location in the world. This either be a your town, city, state, name,
    company or whatever you like. Once you have done this hit the enter key. This will take you back 
    to the main user screen. Your  home location will appear at the top in yellow text, surrounded by a yellow border.
    WorldTime2000 uses the Time Zone settings from you computer ( see control  panel )&nbsp;to determine your
    current time, date and daylight savings for your location. No matter what city, state, or country you  type in, 
    WorldTime2000 will always use the information from the computer's internal clock and date set.
</P>

<H4>Set/Clear Alarm</H4>

<P class=hotkey>
    Right click on location and choose Set/Clear Alarm
</P>

<p>
    This function allows you set an alarm for the selected 
location.&nbsp;To turn an alarm on, make sure
    the check box&nbsp;is checked. To 
    turn it off, be sure the check box is clear. The time is in 
    the time of the selected location, not your home time, unless the location you selected 
    is home. For example, suppose you had to call a friend in Rome, 
    Italy at 10am. Choose Set/Clear alarm for Rome, Italy and enable the check box, 
    and set the hour to 10:00. Type in an optional message if you 
    prefer. At 10:00am Rome time, the alarm will sound, and the alarm message will 
    flash on screen. The alarm will continue to sound until you turn the alarm 
    off. This is done by choosing Reset Alarm from the menu or using hot key space bar. Please note that the&nbsp;alarm 
    re-arms itself after approximately 1 minute. In other words, if you have an alarm 
    set to go off 1 minute after the other, the second one may 
    not go off, depending on how quickly you choose to reset the first alarm. 
</p>                           


<H4>Reset Alarm</H4>
<P class=hotkey>
    Hot key Space bar
</P>          

<p>
    This stops the alarm from beeping. You will get to know 
    this key if you use the alarm feature!. It is the only way of turning off the 
    alarm other than quitting the program. This way, you will be ensured you will 
    not miss an alarm if you are near your computer! 
</p>

        <li>Modifying a location
        <li>Deleting a location
        <li>Displaying a location</li>

    to enter the Name/Town. EXAMPLE: Sydney, Australia or&nbsp;even Bob's place. Then you 
    will asked the Offset in hours from GMT. This is amount of time plus (+) or minus 
    (-) of GMT. You will need to know if the city, town, etc, is currently 
    on Daylight Savings and the start and ending dates. This can also be entered here. 
	If you do not know if the location you wish to add is a user of daylight 
    savings of not, you may not get a correct time reading to another location in 
    WorldTime2000. Once you have entered your new location to add to WorldTime2000 press the ok 
    button. You will the find you new location added to&nbsp;the list of locations found in the 
    Add locations to display list. More often then not you new location will be

    Hot key Ctrl-D
</P>

<P>

    program will ask you to confirm that you wish to delete this location. Once 
    a location has been deleted, the only way to re-establish that location back 
    into the list is to use the Add location feature of the WorldTime2000 program. 
</P>

<H4>Add Location to Display</H4>
<P class=hotkey>
Hot key D
</P>

<P>          
    This function allows you to choose one of the many cities already programed into WorldTime 2000. Once the button 
    has been selected a box with a list will appear. The cites are shown 
    in alphabetical order by the first letter of the city, not country. To the left of 
    the city will be the GMT time either plus (+) or minus (-). 
    Once you have highlighted a city you have the option of seeing more details about 
    that city, by selecting the "show details" button. If this button is selected you 
    will see a more detailed outline of the city. This will show the offset in 
    hours from GMT and weather or not the location is subject to daylight 
    savings. You will notice that this box is the same as the "add location" 
    except for one minor difference. You have the option to modify this location 
    at this point. As before you will be able to see the starting and 
    ending dates for the daylight savings. If a location is modified you are able 
    to return to that location and change the setting back to the original setting or choose a new setting. Once 
    you have selected a location to add to the display and press the button 
    marked "OK", this location will be added to the WorldTime 2000 display screen.&nbsp;The 
    add location to display may also be accessed by using the hot key D.

<li>Moving ? - if you choose to display on screen, then you can view either a spinning globe that sits in the corner, 
or one that moves across the screen into the distance.
<li>Number of Frames - If you choose a moving sphere, 
  this is the number of frames of animation before it disappears into the 
  distance. Larger numbers mean a smoother look, at the expense of taking more 
  processing time.</li>                   
                  
</ol>
<P></P>

<h4>Preferences</h4>
