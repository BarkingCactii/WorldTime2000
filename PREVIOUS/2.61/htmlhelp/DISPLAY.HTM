<p> When you select a location, the location is underlined with the house icon
             This is your temporary 'home', and all hour differences are calculated as differences from this location</p>
 If you keep the mouse still over the location for a few seconds, a tooltip will display.
             This shows the country of the location, the difference from GMT, and what time an alarm is set ( if one has
             been set )
<p> The difference in hours from your selected location

<P>
    This displays a list of locations, line by line. Each location will be 
    displayed, city ( and country if selected ). Following that are a series of status icons. The time 
    at that location will appear next. This is the current time at that location. 
    The Date appears after the time. The last item to show on the same line of 
    your newly added location, will be a number either, plus (+) of Minus (-). 
    This number is to indicate the number of hours from your home location that you 
    selected under Set Home/Reference. 
    The display screen has all the information you need to 
    have in order to find the difference in time from one place to another, and the 
    number of hours difference from one location to another. All locations&nbsp;will show the 
    number of hours difference from your home location on the far right side of 
    the screen. This will either be a plus (+) or minus (-) number of hours to your 
    home location. If your wish to see the difference between two locations other than 
    home, you can <EM><STRONG>Left click</STRONG></EM> on a 
    location, this will <STRONG>underline</STRONG> that 
location, which is now your temporary 'home'. Alternatively, if your mouse sits 
on a location for more than 2 seconds, it will be automatically selected, with a tool tip showing brief information for 
    that location. Now all the numbers on the far right will either be plus (+) 
    or minus (-) number of hours from your temporary 'home', including your home location. 
    If you <STRONG><EM>right click </EM></STRONG>on a location you will have the option to 
    <EM>view, delete, move or Set/Clear Alarm </EM> for a location.
</P>

<P>
    <STRONG>Note</STRONG>: If you remove a location from the display, it does not remove that 
    location from the locations list, just the display. To remove a location from a list,
    choose 'Delete from Locations List' ( even though it is not recommended to do so ).
