<h3><a name="Commands">Commands</a></h3>
<p>There are several ways to perform tasks in WorldTime2000. All these tasks can
be achieved in 4 ways</p>
<ul>
  <li>Main menu</li>
  <li>Context menu ( right click on a location )</li>
  <li>Toolbar</li>
  <li>Hotkeys</li>
</ul>
<p>The 2 major types of tasks are action and view orientated, and are located in
the Action and View menus accordingly. Actions in the main menu, perform general
type tasks such as saving data and setting preferences. To perform actions on an
individual location on the display, right click on that location, and a context
menu will pop up. The action you choose from the context menu will generally
apply to that location only. The most common actions are available as buttons to
select in the toolbar as well.</p>
<p>The current hotkey assignments for actions are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>H - Home</li>
  <li>D - Add Location to
    display</li>
  <li>A - Add Location to
    database</li>
  <li>M - Modify
    Location</li>
  <li>Cntl D - Delete Location</li>
  <li>W - What if
    the time was ?</li>
  <li>Space - Reset Alarm</li>
  <li>P - Preferences</li>
  <li>F - Set Font</li>
  <li>Cntl S - Save Database</li>
  <li>X - Exit Program</li>
  <li>F1 - Help</li>
</ul>
