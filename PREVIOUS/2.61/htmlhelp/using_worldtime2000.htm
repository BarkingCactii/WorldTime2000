<H2>Using WorldTime2000</H2>

<P>
    WorldTime2000 works by having 
    a pre-defined list of locations which contain all the necessary time information for all
    major regions and time zones from around the world. Each location contains information 
    such as hours from GMT, and Daylight savings information. Information about locations can be 
    customized in any way; you can add locations to this list, modify, or delete them. 
    Locations can be cities, states, company branches, relatives/friends homes.
    <BR>

    Using WorldTime2000  falls into 4 categories
