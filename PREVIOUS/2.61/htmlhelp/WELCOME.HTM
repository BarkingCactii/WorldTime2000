<H3>Welcome</H3>

<p>
    WorldTime2000 is an application for simultaneously viewing many different time zones
    from around the world. Great for those who travel or plan to travel, 
    make international phone calls, have business dealings on a national or international level, 
    or have family who live long distances. 

    WorldTime2000 will automatically detect your home, then by simply selecting locations in the 'Add Location 
    to Display' dialog, WorldTime2000 will display the current time for that location, plus the date, 
    the difference in hours from the home location, and if that location is currently in daylight savings<br>
