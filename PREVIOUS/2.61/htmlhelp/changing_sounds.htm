<H4>Changing Sounds</H4>

<P class=hotkey>In Preferences dialog</P>

<P>This lets you choose what sounds you wish to hear for different time events. There
are currently 3 time events:
<ol>
<li>When an alarm sounds
<li>When the time reaches the hour at your home location
<li>When the time reaches a quarterly interval ( eg 4:15, 4:30, 4:45 ) 
  at your home location</li>             
</ol>

WorldTime2000 comes with sounds for each of these 3 events, but you may choose to play any sound on your system.
Do do this, press the button for the event you wish to change the sound for, and select a sound from your computer.<br>
<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> Only PCM wave files 
are supported. This is the standard wave file format. This includes most wave files, but some wave files are not 
encoded in PCM format, but in another format. If this is the case, you will receive a message about the file not being a valid format.
