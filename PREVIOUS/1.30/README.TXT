Installing WorldTime2000 - ( for those that recieved WorldTime2000 as a ZIP file )

WorldTime2000 uses a self extracting install program. Simply click on the file
wt2k-120.exe under Winzip or Explorer, and follow the instructions. Icons will
be created on your desktop, and start menu.

Requirments

WorldTime2000 will run under Win95/95/NT4/2000. WorldTime2000 is a tidy application,
files are not copied to the windows directory, nor does it create temporary files.

This version uses HTML help. This feature requires MS Internet Explorer 4.01 
or later be installed on your computer. You may still use another browser 
for web surfing. The reason : MS Internet Explorer adds desktop enhancements to 
Windows which allows for HTML help.

If you do not have MS Internet Explorer 4.01 installed, and do not wish to do so,
thats ok, you can still use the program, but you will not be able to read the 
help, release notes, ordering or about screens.
